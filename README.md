# stata_demo
I have written some small programs in Stata. My purpose of writing these programs are twofold: (1) to show that beginner user of Stata can use Stata more conveniently if Stata Corp. Ltd. or course instructors add such programs while teaching and (2) while using Stata for the  first time, newbie becomes very excited. They want to do everything at the same time but can not handle so many commands easily. Neither they understand all elements presented in output table. Therefore, course instructors can show only relevant statistic that learners have read in their texts. Moreover, rather than using four/five commands for assumption testing, these can be packed into one program.  Check .sthlp for the details.
